# Case Studies  

These case study is a part of the Google Data Analytic Certification that I completed in July of 2025. In these case study, I am showcasing the 
skills that I learned as part of that course. I'm currently working on a second case study where I showcase the using R, but in the meantime you 
can look at my first project were I primarily focus on using SQL and Tableau.
